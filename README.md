# Bayesian_Classifiers
Short description: MAP estimate, Laplace Approximation and Model Comparison

This was a project for a class on Bayesian Deep Learning as part of my Master's program. 
The sceleton was provided by the professor. Tne functions where points are awarded are the functions I have implemented.
